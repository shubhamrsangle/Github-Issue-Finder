We had a good discussion about the nuances of designing for a user group like autism. A student even brought up the juicy question of whether we should design an app that's accessible for everyone or tailor experiences based on user profiles.

It gives the idea that testing is important to the product software. It does not contain information about how the investigation should be performed and to what extent developers can rely on testing.\nAs an expansion to the above, this report first analyses the role of testing in software development process, then introduces some rules of thumbs to apply general testing techniques, and finally discusses what testing is not and what cannot be achieved through testing.\n2.The Role of Testing in Software Development\nThe importance of testing in a software development process is necessary to be understood by every software engineer, but is also trivial. Testing does not only reduce number of bugs in codes, it also examines if the implemented functionalities meet the corresponding requirements.\n2.1 Testing in Waterfall Model\nIn a traditional waterfall model, testing is the one last step before the product system is delivered to customer. All assessments about meeting the requirements are carried out at this stage. However, with very limited time allowed for the entire project, it is very often that the time remaining for testing is squeezed heavily.\nMoreover, In a fast changing environment, it is quite possible that by the time the system is completed, the original requirements may have already become old fashioned. In addition, in the case of a small project, more time could be spent on planning and documentation than on designing, implementing and testing.\nThus, comprehensive testing is rarely finished. The step which is equivalent to quality checking for the product system cannot receive enough time to proceed. [2]\n2.2 Testing in Incremental Model\nIn contrast with waterfall model, the incremental model has emerged in this rapidly changing environment. Methods of this model like Agile or XP usually use a test-driven development approach. In this approach, the whole project is broken down into several increments or iterations to be completed in shorter time boxes. In each iteration, tests are written before the actual implementation. An implementation is correct only if it can pass the existing test cases designed for it.\nAs a result, testing is interleaved with analysis, design, and implementation. So developers can spend more effective time on testing to have it carefully planned and carried out.\n3.Principles of Testing\nAfter having a good understanding of the importance of testing, this section discusses how general testing methods and techniques, i.e. static and dynamic methods, box testing, unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, etc., are applied in normal software development projects.\n3.1 Test a program to try to make it fail\nDijkstra said that \"testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3]\". The interpretation of this is obvious: except for trivial systems, those many test cases a developer can come up with are just a part of all possible scenarios. So testing is to execute the program with the intention to find bugs [4], not with the intention to show it is bug free. A good testing practice should show the program fails at some point, and after debugging, it can show the program successes at the same point.\n3.2 Test early and regularly\nNot surprising at all, fixing bugs is more expensive if it spotted at a later stage, but it is surprising how tremendously more expensive it is. Figure 1 shows that, in a waterfall model, cost of finding and fixing bugs is the result of an exponential function of time. It is also the case in test-driven approach, where a bug in an early iteration can accumulate to become a bigger problem and propagate to other components.\nFigure 1. Cost of Fixing Bugs in Warterfall Model [5]\nAdditionally, tests should be carried out on a regular basis since when new components are added in, they may have unexpected effects on existing ones. Also, as long as the requirements are changed, test cases should be updated accordingly.\n3.3 Testing is context dependant\nThe test methods to be used should depend on the context of the system to satisfy various requirements [6]. Test cases should be composed according to different components. Even with the same component in the same system, testing objectives can be different at different point of time. For example, unit testing checks if each component functions properly as individuals, while integration testing focuses on interaction between several components as a whole.\n3.4 Define a Test Plan\nA test plan should address test scope, test strategy, test methods and techniques, test results interpretation, and how comprehensive the test cases are to cover the possible scenarios. Also importantly, it should include how the tests are going to reveal the customer requirements, and how requirements are measured [7][8][9]. Furthermore, a risk assessment of the system under development should be considered here. The essence of risk assessment can be illustrated from the negative results of software disasters such as the Denver Airport Baggage Handling System [10] and the Fukoshima Nuclear Disaster [11]. Missing or under evaluating a risk may result in too few or even no specific tests covering this risk at all, which will further result in hidden faults, which finally leads to system failure.\n3.5 Test for valid as well as invalid inputs\nTest cases should of course include valid inputs, thus to mimic regular scenarios, which are the most likely real life situations. After those, developers should think about if things can go wrong with invalid inputs such as null pointers, out-of-bound index, etc. The reason is not only because statistically there are always a chance for exceptions to occur, but it is also quite often that a system is crashed by a single component which has got an unexpected input. Moreover, an interesting thing is, during testing, invalid input conditions seem to have higher error detection yield than test cases with valid input conditions [4].\n4.Limitations of Testing\n4.1 Testing cannot show bug-free\nAlso according to that famous quote of Dijkstra: \"Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3].\" In reality, testing is based on comparing actual outputs to expected outputs of a component in response to some inputs. These inputs are just a subset of all possible scenarios. Since very likely there are a great many of possibilities, it is rarely practical for one to be able to carry out exhaust testing. Hence, a good test case may indicate the existence of a fault within some component, or after the fault is corrected, it may show that component does not produce a particular kind of error when it receives a particular kind of input, but it never gives the idea that this component does not produce any kind of bug in response to any kind of input.\n4.2 Tests are no substitute for specifications\nWith test-driven methods, developers write codes to pass the tests. Conventionally, the code becomes deliverable once it passes all tests. So to some extent, testing has substituted the requirement specification. However, tests, no matter how many test cases they include, are just instances of the requirements, which provide an abstraction of the expected outcome [12]. It is true that requirement specification is used for generating test cases, but inversely, using test cases to summarise a requirement is a conduct should be avoided. It is like a universal statement can be used to prove as many existential statements with the same predicate as desired, but no matter how many existential statements conjunction together, they cannot be used to prove a single universal statement with the same predicate.\n4.3 Software testing does not help in finding root causes\nIEEE standard terminology states:\n\"An unsatisfactory program execution is a 'failure', pointing to a 'fault' in the program, itself is the result of a 'mistake' in the programmer\u2019s thinking.\"\nAccording to section 3.1, testing is to execute the program to make it fail. It is the process to uncover failures in the program. So testing tells the developers the test subject does not generate satisfactory output in response to some certain inputs. However, it does not tell how the inputs are processed to result in such outputs. In other words, testing does not help in finding root causes, i.e. where, when, and how things go wrong, which lead the software to malfunction in the first place. That is done via another distinct activity known as debugging.\n4.4 Extra Coding and Extra Chance to Have Bugs\nNo matter how automated the testing procedure a project is using, it requires some minimal level of human coding in the first place. Obviously, coding for testing means extra work to do. From instantiating components and initialising test inputs, to inter-component communication and results interpretation\uff0c every piece of work is an additional programming task. Moreover, additional programming means additional chance to have bugs. For a failed test case, a developer has to check both the source code and test code for faults, because it may turn out to be that the logic or result interpretation is wrong within the test code.\n5.Recommendation\nLet us examine the definition in section 1 given by Kaner again. It is true that passing tests can at least show the software does not produce faulty outputs in situations covered by existing test cases. Plus, if these test cases are carefully planned, then it is reasonable for the stakeholders to be confident in the software's correctness. So the connection between testing and quality does exist and is important to keep in mind.\nHowever, passing tests is equivalent to quality assurance for the product system is usually not the case. Test cases are instances of real life situations. They are elements of a subset of all possible inputs. What testing can prove is merely the performance based on that subset. Using the property of a subset to draw a conclusion for the full set is absolutely invalid.\n6.References\n[1] Kaner, C, 2006, Exploratory Testing, Key Note at QAI\nhttp://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf\n[2] Sommerville, I, 2011, Software Engineering, 9th Edition, Pearson, Boston\n[3] Dijkstra J.N.

The orbiter was also supposed to be the communications relay for the Mars Polar Lander. NASA launched this device into Mars to achieve several science objectives. First, the device was expected to monitor the weather & atmospheric conditions in Mars on a daily basis. The climate orbiter was also required to record and report any evidence of climate change. Other objectives included an analysis of the water distribution, temperature profiles, water vapour, and dust content on the Martian Surface.\n2 The NASA Mars Orbiter\n2.1 A catastrophic Software Failure:\n    The NASA Mars Orbiter was developed and launched at a time when NASA was operating under the \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d philosophy that was supposed to encourage the organization to achieve more objectives with fewer resources (MCO, 2000). The organization aimed at increasing productivity & innovation while at the same time ensuring cost-effective and safe approaches to the achievement of mission success. The \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d initiative led to the restructuring of many missions and programs to achieve the objectives of this approach (MCO, 2000). Using this approach, the costs incurred in programs were highly reduced but the infusion of technology and content were increased. This is the background and philosophy under which NASA was operating when the Mars Orbiter was launched. This approach may be a contributing factor to the failure in the greater scheme of things.\n\nThis is because, as the implementation of projects using this approach evolved, the attention on schedule & cost increased leading to unacceptable levels of risk in NASA projects (MCO, 2000). Even today, NASA may be operating using an approach where there is very high risk in some initiatives by increasing scope and reducing cost (Stone, 2000). \n2.2 The NASA Mars Orbiter Software Failure:\nReports indicate that the failure of the NASA Mars Orbiter was caused by a catastrophic failure in a piece of ground software. The failure on the ground software led to some discrepancies since this software calculated & produced its results in imperial units while the system that was expecting the results of these calculations was expecting them in ISO / metric units (Hoekenga, 2012). Therefore, the error in the navigation of the obiter device was caused by the software that controlled the thrusters since it was not calibrated in SI units i.e. the navigation device in the orbiter expected to receive the values in Newtons while the computer that completed the calculations delivered pound-forces (Board, 1999). According to Douglas & Don (1999), this piece of ground software may have been inadequately tested leading to the errors that were experienced in the calculations. As a result of the delivery of results using the wrong units there was a discrepancy in the calculated & measured positions of the orbiter which led to a large discrepancy in the location of the device in terms of its expected & actual position in orbital insertion altitude. Even though this was earlier noted by some engineers, their concerns were dismissed but later it emerged that the orbiter was in the wrong position in terms of its orbital insertion altitude (Douglas & Don, 1999). This discrepancy led to the loss of the orbiter which probably crashed in an unknown location. After the error was discovered, an urgent meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a trajectory manoeuvre. However, this manoeuvre was ultimately dismissed as the NASA Mars Orbiter was considered lost. There were some responses by NASA following this catastrophic failure and loss of the orbiter. In the next section, we shall consider the actions taken by NASA and the appropriateness of these measures.\n2.3 Responses to the Failure of the Software and their Appropriateness:\nImmediately after the loss of the orbiter, NASA constituted a board called the \u201cMars Climate Orbiter Board\u201d to investigate the matter and forward their recommendations to NASA (MCO, 2000). The report produced by the board cited some contributory factors that led to this catastrophic failure. The report noted that the errors that were being experienced but went undetected within the computer models of the ground-based systems in relation to how thruster firings were being predicted and executed. The computer based models on the ground missed the errors experienced in the thrust firings while the orbiter was in its interplanetary journey to Mars. MCO (2000) noted that the software error that led to the loss of the orbiter was not the first error by the software. The author predicts that there were other small errors in the interplanetary trip that were not noted by ground computer models. \n\nAnother contributory factor as noted by the board was that the navigation team in the NASA operations centre was not quite informed on the details of how the orbiter was pointed in space as accurately as it was done in other programs. Further, the fact that the optional thrust firing to raise the path of the orbiter relative to mars was considered but it was not performed was also a contributory factor. The board also noted that the Systems Engineering department of NASA was required to double-check the operation of all interconnected parts but this was not done well (MCO, 2000). There was also the problem of informal communication channels among engineering groups and some personnel were not trained sufficiently on the navigational aspects of the operation. Ultimately, the process of verification and validation of systems engineering requirements and technical aspects of the project was inadequate.\n\nWhen the software error was discovered, NASA called an immediate meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5). However, this manoeuvre was never done after consultations with NASA top management. After the investigations and recommendations by the board, NASA took some actions to ensure that such a failure would not occur again. In response to the recommendations of the board, NASA has taken some efforts to ensure that the systems engineering team is fully staffed at the beginning of each project. Further, the organization makes sure that the engineering team is in possession of the required skills to work with the subsystem engineers and set up an efficient communication flow. NASA also engages personnel in operations at the early stages of the project to ensure that they have a detailed knowledge of the project. In the project formulation phase, a set of mission requirements is developed early in the project formulation phase, Further, a \u201cthrough flow-down\u201d of the requirements of every system is done to the subsystem level (MCO, 2000). According to MCO (2000), NASA also conducts system analyses to identify mission risks in all segments and sub-systems in the project. The project teams must also work thoroughly to make \u201ctrade-off decisions\u201d that treat & mitigate risks in a bid to increase the probability of mission success (MCO, 2000). A recommendation has also been made and approved to deploy alternative navigational schemes in space missions and \u201crelative navigation\u201d is done when the device is in the vicinity of other planets (MCO, 2000). Technology developments for optical tracking, autonomous orbital determination based on GPS is also being pursued.\n\nThe immediate action taken by NASA to conduct an emergency meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was appropriate and it may have resulted in positive impacts on the project. However, their resolution to dismiss the TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5) meant that this immediate action did not achieve any result. I think that this effort did not lead to positive results for the mission since the team did not conduct the TCM-5 manoeuvre. The team should have completed the TCM-5 manoeuvre since it would have had no further consequences on the costs of the mission.\n\nThe long-term actions mentioned above will have far reaching implications for NASA. After the recommendations of the investigations board, the actions of NASA to establish a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training will lead to more costs being incurred. However, even though more costs will be incurred, these actions are appropriate since they can prevent mission failure which leads to even greater financial losses. For instance, the loss of the orbiter led to a $125 million loss. Taking actions such as the ones recommended above will led to increased costs but these will not be in the scale of the cost of mission failure. Their actions to perform continual system analysis, risk identification, tracking technology and alternative navigational schemes are also appropriate but they will lead to more costs being incurred. Similarly, these costs do not surpass the costs of mission failure which means that these actions are justifiable.\n3 Conclusion\nThe loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter led to a loss of at least $125 million \u2013 the loss was due to a failure in software. The ground based software calculated its output in imperial units while the orbiter was expecting these results in ISO / Metric Units. The measures taken by NASA in accordance to the report by the investigation board included the establishment of a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training. Other measures included performing continual system analysis, risk identification, using tracking technology and developing alternative navigational schemes. Even though these measures will increase operational costs for NASA, they are appropriate since they can be justified by the fact that the additional costs cannot be compared to the costs of mission failure.\n\n4 Reference List\nBoard, M.

It helped me to increase the productivity of my customer and to tighten the requirements definition process and management as well. Basically what the KOREM plugin was intended for.\nAs I suggested my customer to select a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach for their projects to collect requirements I added the possibility to KOREM to add so called features from the BDD philosophy to the Redmine database. For further information on this please read on here.\nOne missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.\nSo I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the \"Export\" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.\nI would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.\nCheers,\nMarvin Kruse\nPhilotech GmbH", "gimmebytes wants to merge 15 commits into tmerten:master\nfrom gimmebytes:master", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/issues/98", "No Silver Bullet article - also see chapter 16 of \"The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering\" by Frederick Brooks\nLink to Prof. Anthony Finkelstein is broken\nThe Agile manifesto - Folwer should be Fowler", "mattgillucl opened this issue on 7 Sep \u00b7 1 comment", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse/issues/3", "No description provided.", "stevenschwenke opened this issue on 12 Mar 2017 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse/issues/2", "No description provided.", "stevenschwenke opened this issue on 12 Mar 2017 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"]], "search": [["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/213", "Add fuzzy matching\nPotentially:\n-indexing by tags (search for \"databases\" should maybe take into account episodes with that tag unless it would be too noisy)\n-search by date", "crablar opened this issue on 19 Apr \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/issues/528", "Searching on desktop seems limited", "crablar opened this issue on 2 Jun \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/issues/516", "Idea: mimic the look of github labels like \"good first issue\" \"bug\" only make those \"projects\"; \"episode discussion\"; \"questions\" etc buttons at the top of the forum posts list, so we can filter and see just one category if we want, instead of the endless scroll.\nAlso: add search functionality to forum, or include forum search results in softwaredaily.com overall search results.", "erikawho opened this issue on 18 May \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/se-daily-iOS/issues/88", "Main:\nlet me know that something is happening\nlet me know that no results came back\nReplicate: Was searching \"multithreaded\" pointing to prod.

I was looking through your online book, and I wanted to point out that there's a design issue in the section on inheritance. From the text:\nHowever, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class Person because of the need to distinguish between Man and Woman for the \u2018marriage\u2019 association. A solution is to add the Person class as a super class and let Man and Woman inherit from Person.\nGiven that same-sex marriage is legal in most of the developed world, distinguishing between Man and Woman in the class Marriage makes the implementation fragile to changes in requirements. A more robust solution is to use the type Person.\nThis is actually a really good example of how untested assumptions that we as software engineers make can come back to haunt us later.

that the problem comes from:\neu.sqooss.plugins.tds.svn.SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision line 320.\nIf we see at the implementation we will realize that the call at:\nlog = getSVNLog(\"\", svnrev.getSVNRevision(), -1) (line 319)\nwill return an empty list.\nSo the first bug here is that we have an uncatched exception, because we call the iterator().next(), method on an empty list!!!\nHaving some experience with svn and SVNKit and looking at the implementation of method: List getSVNLog(String repoPath, long revstart, long revend)\n(SVNAccessorImpl) it seems that you are trying to call:\norg.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.SVNRepository.log() with the startRev same as the latest revision of the repository and the startRev -1. In this case, the implementation of SVNKit's SVNRepository.log() will put endRev = startRev, so you are expected to get the latest SVNLogEntry. However the call to that method return no log entry in our case, why?\nThe problems lies at the fact that ASF has a central SVN repository with a lot of projects there, so the latest revision in our case doesn't correspond to a change made to the path /commons/proper/io (in repo) that is why it returns no log entries. However when we call SVNRepository.getLatestRevision() it will return the latest revision of the repository, and in our case because someone has made a change to another project within ASF's repository all the repo's tree revision number will equal to the latest commit number.\nIn other words there is a problem with the implementation of SVNAccessorImpl:\nIf we have a repository with lot of projects we cant add one of those projects to Alitheia. I believe that this is a serious limitation, having in mind that ASF is a very valuable repository of OSS projects, especially of Java based projects (look at Apache Commons).\nI think there is a workaround here. Here is the description:\nLet say we have a repo with multiply projects and we want to get the last commit of a certain project (suppose ASF's repo). We create the repository object for that project (commons-io):\n    DAVRepositoryFactory.setup();\n    String url = \"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io\";\n    SVNURL svnurl = SVNURL.parseURIDecoded(url);\n    SVNRepository repository = SVNRepositoryFactory.create(svnurl);\n    ISVNAuthenticationManager authenticationManager =     \n                                    SVNWCUtil.createDefaultAuthenticationManager();\n    repository.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);\nIn order to get the last log of the repo we have:\n    long lastRev = repository.getLatestRevision();\nThe lastRev, however, might be a revision that doesn't affect the project, so in your implementation it can not be resolved (see SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision()).\nIn order to get (or let say to resolve) the last revision that affected any of the files/folder under /commons/proper/io we can take all the logs:\nCollection<SVNLogEntry> logs = repository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, null, 0, lastRev, true, true);\nand the last revision is the last item at logs collection. Or a better implementation would be:\nrepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n        @Override\n        public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n            System.out.println(\"Last rev (handler):\" + svnLogEntry.getRevision());\n        }\n    });\nThe last implementation, will avoid to download all log entries, and it will start in descending order, so the last revision will be the first entry that is passed at handler (look at parameters, we have set lastRev, 0). With this code you can easily resolve last revisions in repositories such as this, we are working with. I think the only method that must be changed would be the:\nprivate long getHeadSVNRevision() throws InvalidRepositoryException {\n    long endRevision = -1;\n    if (svnRepository == null) {\n        connectToRepository();\n    }\n    try {\n        long lastRev = svnRepository.getLatestRevision();\n        final Rev revision = new Rev(-1);\n        svnRepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n                revision.rev = svnLogEntry.getRevision();\n            }\n        });\n        endRevision = revision.rev;\n    } catch (SVNException e) {\n        logger.warn(\"Could not get latest revision of \" + url\n                + e.getMessage());\n        throw new InvalidRepositoryException(url, e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    return endRevision;\n}\n\nprivate static class Rev { long rev; Rev(long r) { rev = r; } }\nIn my case it works, however, I cant say for sure if it affects other components of alitheia because, I haven't managed to Add Project (it can't find a BTS accessor and Mail accessor so it throws exceptions) so I cant Update All and try some metrics (or in the best scenario I haven't any test cases to run against).\n*It is very strange the procedure of how should someone can Add Project *\nEDIT:\nThe new implementation of getHeadSVNRevision() will work the same as the previous one if there is a \"one project per repo\", it will return the HEAD of the whole repo, however if there is a \"multiply projects per repo\" it will return the last log that affected any of the files under the path that scm.source URL is pointing.", "eligu opened this issue on 3 Nov 2013 \u00b7 13 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/issues/119", "See #67", "alexorso opened this issue on 17 Dec 2015 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/se-daily-iOS/issues/71", "Cannot bookmark 2 most recent episodes.\nSteps to reproduce: bookmark the most recent episode, check bookmarks", "crablar opened this issue on 15 Mar \u00b7 4 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/sesa-uottawa/uottawasesa/issues/46", "The buttons seem all grouped together.

Here, \"important types\" is vague; why force the reader to read unnamed authors et al.

Although the script has been working fine in general, two issues (#96 and #184) have been reported related to that regex expression.

This must change; more decisions must be made analytically; this chapter describes an analystics design sheet whose adoption will transform decision-making.\nAccessible?\nIs the chapters written for a generalist audience (no excessive use of technical terminology) with a minimum of diagrams and references?\nThe chapter is indeed aimed at a generalist audience.\nHow can it be made more accessible to generalist?\nImprove the illustrative example with more concrete detail, a point to which I return below.\nSize?\nIs the chapter the right length?\nI understand the lenght to be 4 pages, including references. The current draft is one line over.\nWhat are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?\nThe example would be more helpful if it were more concrete; specifically, if the nodes in the conceptual model were spelled out: the letters E, S, and F are quite abstract.\nCopyedits\nThe following sentence parses poorly.\n\"This often implies delays in delivering products or lack of quality.\"\nThe problem is that one can distribute the gerund over the or,\nnot the verb implies. I suggest\nThis often implies lack of quality or delays in delivering products.\nBefore the bullet list at the end of the introduction: to-wards -> towards.\nIn the bulleted list,\n\"likelihood to make\" -> \"likelihood of making\"\n\"likelihood of avoiding to make\" -> \"likelihood of avoiding making\"\nstill better would be\n\"likelihood of avoiding a wrong decision\"\nThe most important types of analytics are the ones least studied by researchers [5].\nCitation abuse is making a citation that does not stand on its own, but requires the reader to consult the referenced work in detail to understand the citation. Here, \"important types\" is vague; why force the reader to read unnamed authors et al. [5] to learn what they are?\nAHS -> ADS\nTitles are not in title case.\nCitations are not nouns.\nGotta Mantra?\nWe encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.\nA checklist for software decisions\nSupporting software decisions\nBest Points\nIn seeking to support decision making in software engineering, the authors are attacking a seminal, yet neglected software engineering problem.", "barr opened this issue on 21 Dec 2015 \u00b7 2 comments", "Solved"]], "list": [["https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application/issues/200", "How about adding an Excel version of the list of companies so you can track the applications better?

For instance, supposing the following test suite with a failing test method (test1):\npublic class TestFoo {\n  @Test\n  public void test0() {\n    assertTrue(true);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void test1() {\n    String str = new String();\n    str = 123456789;\n  }\n}\nis then transformed to:\npublic class TestFoo {\n  @Test\n  public void test0() {\n    assertTrue(true);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void test1() {}\n// Defects4J: flaky method\n//   @Test\n//   public void test1() {\n//     String str = new String();\n//     str = 123456789;\n//   }\n}\nBasically, the script parses the compilation/execution output and identifies the line where the failing test method starts/ends and it uses a regex expression to remove all string/character and comments of the failing test method as they may contain unbalanced delimiters or brackets (which may cause problems to find the last } of the test method). Although the script has been working fine in general, two issues (#96 and #184) have been reported related to that regex expression. Perhaps a more robust solution would be to build a parser that computes a line-number table for all methods and then use that table to comment out failing test methods.", "jose opened this issue 5 days ago \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/slebok/slebok/issues/14", "To avoid slippery slope, we should remove terms like \"closure\", \"encapsulation\", \"higher-order function\" etc. These terms might be relevant if you are defining a programming language, but are not SLE terms per se IMHO.", "tvdstorm opened this issue on 24 Aug 2017 \u00b7 2 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/se-edu/se-book/issues/51", "Use 'you' instead.", "damithc opened this issue on 30 Jun \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/se-edu/se-book/issues/46", "TopicToc.md at lower level topics don't seem to be used", "damithc opened this issue on 6 Jun \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/se-edu/se-book/issues/40", "The answer can contain just the a, b, c etc. like so:\n<panel header=\":lock::key: What are the advantages of using use cases (the textual form) for requirements modelling?\">\n<question>\n\nWhat are the advantages of using use cases (the textual form) for requirements modelling?\n\n- [ ] a.

Although the script has been working fine in general, two issues (#96 and #184) have been reported related to that regex expression.

After that I found that it is the code in MonthTests.java:\n\"\"\"\"\n// test 3...\ntry {\nmonth = Month.parseMonth(\"March 1993\");\n}\ncatch (TimePeriodFormatException e) {\nmonth = new Month(1, 1900);\n}\nassertEquals(3, month.getMonth());\nassertEquals(1993, month.getYear().getYear());\n\"\"\"\"\nthat triggers the failure of Month.java.\nSo is it a bug which is omitted by Defects4j file?\nI mean, in the file produced by Defect4j, only one failing test is recorded. But when I run the buggy program Chart_5 I have got two failing tests. So could anyone offer some help or guidance?

I think it went really well. We covered a lot of ground with an overview of accessibility development and then a deep dive into autism. I included two brainstorming breakouts with their teams. They identified some problem areas with their current apps (e.g., lack of keyboard support, inaccessible graphics). I talked about the semantic web & that seemed like new info to everyone. We had a good discussion about the nuances of designing for a user group like autism. A student even brought up the juicy question of whether we should design an app that's accessible for everyone or tailor experiences based on user profiles. I think there's value in having this type of accessibility-focused module in the course going forward. Or incorporating accessibility principles in the other modules.

I would anticipate it soon after the student\u2019s case and rephrase it a bit explaining what is in general the problem in analyzing defect data across releases. Perhaps just removing the sentence \u201cThe following sections discuss how steps (1) and (2) can go wrong when the release process of a project is not taken into account, and what could be done to resolve these problems.\u201d and rephrasing the second sentence can be enough. (3) I would suggest saying explicitly \u201cfile-level defect prediction model\u201d (i.e., removing the brackets around \u201cfile-level\u201d) as there are other defect prediction models that do not use file characteristics.

It is nice the suspense created by the title (one does not understand what should be open from the beginning) but I am afraid this game can play against raising the interest of reading the chapter. Let me suggest that the title includes the term Research since it is what the chapter discusses. Even the mantra you have to end the chapter would make a nice title. Or even in research openness done is better than perfect.\nBest Points\nWhat are the best points of the chapter that the authors should NOT change?\nColloquial language.

The chapter is engaging to read and the message is very clear. I also liked seeing the key takeaways paragraph at the end to emphasize that continuous experimentation is necessary to understand that software is addressing a right problem.\nA few sentences were rather confusing.

It is already accessible.\nSize?\nIs the chapter the right length?\nYes.\nShould anything missing be added?\nNo.\nCan anything superfluous be removed (e.g. by deleting some section that does not work so well or by using less jargon, less formulae, lees diagrams, less references).?\nNo.\nWhat are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?\n1. Perhaps the \"what to do\" section could be organised in a way that the different items can be related to each other. As they are now they are a bit confusing. A possibility could be organising them according to the phases identified in the figure.\n2.

If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.\nNo need to change the title. Perhaps the author could consider adding something like: \"Avoiding being too late\" or something like that.

It helped me to increase the productivity of my customer and to tighten the requirements definition process and management as well. Basically what the KOREM plugin was intended for.\nAs I suggested my customer to select a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach for their projects to collect requirements I added the possibility to KOREM to add so called features from the BDD philosophy to the Redmine database. For further information on this please read on here.\nOne missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.\nSo I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the \"Export\" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.\nI would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.\nCheers,\nMarvin Kruse\nPhilotech GmbH", "gimmebytes wants to merge 15 commits into tmerten:master\nfrom gimmebytes:master", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/briandiaz/OpenCRM/issues/22", "Add, at least, Spanish Language Support", "freddy-mesa opened this issue on 2 Dec 2013 \u00b7 1 comment", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/ZEPL/data-engineering-challenge/pull/8", "How to run test\n./gradlew test\nHow to run\n./gradlew run\nor\n./gradlew fatJar\njava -jar build/libs/todo-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 8000\nDesign Decisions/Thinking\nNot used mock because it's simple\ntime vs string for created field - There's no date manipulation, so I'll use String\nIntentionally less comments - Try to write self-explained code\nSplit Todo/Task of Dao, Service, Resource?

that the problem comes from:\neu.sqooss.plugins.tds.svn.SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision line 320.\nIf we see at the implementation we will realize that the call at:\nlog = getSVNLog(\"\", svnrev.getSVNRevision(), -1) (line 319)\nwill return an empty list.\nSo the first bug here is that we have an uncatched exception, because we call the iterator().next(), method on an empty list!!!\nHaving some experience with svn and SVNKit and looking at the implementation of method: List getSVNLog(String repoPath, long revstart, long revend)\n(SVNAccessorImpl) it seems that you are trying to call:\norg.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.SVNRepository.log() with the startRev same as the latest revision of the repository and the startRev -1. In this case, the implementation of SVNKit's SVNRepository.log() will put endRev = startRev, so you are expected to get the latest SVNLogEntry. However the call to that method return no log entry in our case, why?\nThe problems lies at the fact that ASF has a central SVN repository with a lot of projects there, so the latest revision in our case doesn't correspond to a change made to the path /commons/proper/io (in repo) that is why it returns no log entries. However when we call SVNRepository.getLatestRevision() it will return the latest revision of the repository, and in our case because someone has made a change to another project within ASF's repository all the repo's tree revision number will equal to the latest commit number.\nIn other words there is a problem with the implementation of SVNAccessorImpl:\nIf we have a repository with lot of projects we cant add one of those projects to Alitheia. I believe that this is a serious limitation, having in mind that ASF is a very valuable repository of OSS projects, especially of Java based projects (look at Apache Commons).\nI think there is a workaround here. Here is the description:\nLet say we have a repo with multiply projects and we want to get the last commit of a certain project (suppose ASF's repo). We create the repository object for that project (commons-io):\n    DAVRepositoryFactory.setup();\n    String url = \"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io\";\n    SVNURL svnurl = SVNURL.parseURIDecoded(url);\n    SVNRepository repository = SVNRepositoryFactory.create(svnurl);\n    ISVNAuthenticationManager authenticationManager =     \n                                    SVNWCUtil.createDefaultAuthenticationManager();\n    repository.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);\nIn order to get the last log of the repo we have:\n    long lastRev = repository.getLatestRevision();\nThe lastRev, however, might be a revision that doesn't affect the project, so in your implementation it can not be resolved (see SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision()).\nIn order to get (or let say to resolve) the last revision that affected any of the files/folder under /commons/proper/io we can take all the logs:\nCollection<SVNLogEntry> logs = repository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, null, 0, lastRev, true, true);\nand the last revision is the last item at logs collection. Or a better implementation would be:\nrepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n        @Override\n        public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n            System.out.println(\"Last rev (handler):\" + svnLogEntry.getRevision());\n        }\n    });\nThe last implementation, will avoid to download all log entries, and it will start in descending order, so the last revision will be the first entry that is passed at handler (look at parameters, we have set lastRev, 0). With this code you can easily resolve last revisions in repositories such as this, we are working with. I think the only method that must be changed would be the:\nprivate long getHeadSVNRevision() throws InvalidRepositoryException {\n    long endRevision = -1;\n    if (svnRepository == null) {\n        connectToRepository();\n    }\n    try {\n        long lastRev = svnRepository.getLatestRevision();\n        final Rev revision = new Rev(-1);\n        svnRepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n                revision.rev = svnLogEntry.getRevision();\n            }\n        });\n        endRevision = revision.rev;\n    } catch (SVNException e) {\n        logger.warn(\"Could not get latest revision of \" + url\n                + e.getMessage());\n        throw new InvalidRepositoryException(url, e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    return endRevision;\n}\n\nprivate static class Rev { long rev; Rev(long r) { rev = r; } }\nIn my case it works, however, I cant say for sure if it affects other components of alitheia because, I haven't managed to Add Project (it can't find a BTS accessor and Mail accessor so it throws exceptions) so I cant Update All and try some metrics (or in the best scenario I haven't any test cases to run against).\n*It is very strange the procedure of how should someone can Add Project *\nEDIT:\nThe new implementation of getHeadSVNRevision() will work the same as the previous one if there is a \"one project per repo\", it will return the HEAD of the whole repo, however if there is a \"multiply projects per repo\" it will return the last log that affected any of the files under the path that scm.source URL is pointing.", "eligu opened this issue on 3 Nov 2013 \u00b7 13 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core/issues/4", "I get an error while trying to update a module via maven->update project\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Updating Maven Project\".\nUnsupported IClasspathEntry kind=4", "teohaik opened this issue on 18 Sep 2013 \u00b7 3 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/ThierrySans/CSCC01/issues/11", "In the Markdown file front matter you put the permalink as /work/06, but the project page links to /project/02.", "nakamin opened this issue on 24 Sep \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/SEDaily-Android/issues/87", "CodeBeat seems to have some nice features (and UI) for code analysis", "kvithayathil opened this issue on 16 Dec 2017 \u00b7 1 comment", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/truonganhhoang/USTH-SE-2018/issues/72", "A function here refers to an use case, or a user story.

They identified some problem areas with their current apps (e.g., lack of keyboard support, inaccessible graphics). I talked about the semantic web & that seemed like new info to everyone. We had a good discussion about the nuances of designing for a user group like autism. A student even brought up the juicy question of whether we should design an app that's accessible for everyone or tailor experiences based on user profiles.

The main objective of test plan is examine the program behavior and accuracy. The functioning of the game is to tilt the gaming board (4X4 grid) to move the tiles containing values floating on the board in the left, right, top and bottom direction. The objective of the game is to merge the two tiles containing the same values and the resulting tile will represent the summation of two equal values. After merging two tiles a tilt of the gaming board in any direction will generate a new tile with the multiple value of 2, 4, 16 e.g. The ultimate goal of the game is to achieve a tile containing the value 2048. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value produced with the merging of two identical tiles. At the beginning of the game two tiles containing either 2 or 4 will be appeared in two random locations of the gaming board. The score will be initialized as zero at the beginning of the game. The game will be considered to be over while there is no empty cell left to move any of the tiles on the board and while the player achieved the tile containing value 2048.\nSoftware Specifications\ni. NetBeans IDE version 8\nii. Github account algh0065\niii. Internet connection\nTest Scenarios\nGame Board Representation\nAt the initial stage of the game a test is performed to check the representation of the board. The test is performed for game board representation as follows:\ni. A 4X4 grid will represent the entire board of the game, where two tiles will be highlighted at random locations of the board in the beginning.\nii. The highlighted two tiles will contain 2 values individually.\nSubstantiation of User Input\nIn order to verify the user input the following test steps are performed.\ni. The input is considered to be valid if the user chooses any of the keyboard buttons namely 1, 2, 3, 4, or x.\nii. The input is considered to be invalid if the use chooses any other buttons other than 1, 2, 3, 4 or x.\niii. An invalid input resulting in error message pop-up saying that invalid input.\nConducting User Input\nThis will test the movements of the board while pressing particular input button.\ni. The game board must be tilted up for the input of \u20181\u2019 button of the keyboard.\nii. The game board must be tilted down for the input of \u20182\u2019 button of the keyboard.\niii. The game board must be tilted right for the input of \u20183\u2019 button of the keyboard.\niv. The game board must be tilted left for the input of \u20184\u2019 button of the keyboard.\nTilting in the Up Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move up.\ni. Tiles must move to the up when there are empty cells in the above of the columns of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the up and merge a tile of the same value in the above of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the up when there is no empty cell in the above of the column of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the up when they reached the top most position (i.e., top edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Down Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move down.\ni. Tiles must move to the down when there are empty cells in the below of the columns of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the down and merge a tile of the same value in the below of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the down when there is no empty cell in the below of the column of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the down when they reached the bottom most position (i.e., bottom edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Right Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move right.\ni. Tiles must move to the right when there are empty cells in the right of the rows of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the right and merge a tile of the same value in the right of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the right when there is no empty cell in the right of the row of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the right when they reached the right most position (i.e., right edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Left Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move left.\ni. Tiles must move to the left when there are empty cells in the left of the rows of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the left and merge a tile of the same value in the left of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the left when there is no empty cell in the left of the row of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the left when they reached the left most position (i.e., left edge) of the board.\nCondition for Merging Two Tiles\nThis will illustrate the condition for which two tiles will be merged into one.\ni. Merging is possible to get one tile with the addition of the values containing two tiles only when the two tiles containing the same value and positioned adjacent to each other.\nScore Calculation\nThe score of the game will be calculated in the following ways:\nii. At the very beginning of the game the score will be initialized as zero.\niii. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value obtained through merging of two tiles of equal values.\nGame Expiration (Game Over)\nThe game will be expired in the following conditions:\ni. The user may terminate the game anytime during the game by pressing the \u2018x\u2019 button.\nii.

that the problem comes from:\neu.sqooss.plugins.tds.svn.SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision line 320.\nIf we see at the implementation we will realize that the call at:\nlog = getSVNLog(\"\", svnrev.getSVNRevision(), -1) (line 319)\nwill return an empty list.\nSo the first bug here is that we have an uncatched exception, because we call the iterator().next(), method on an empty list!!!\nHaving some experience with svn and SVNKit and looking at the implementation of method: List getSVNLog(String repoPath, long revstart, long revend)\n(SVNAccessorImpl) it seems that you are trying to call:\norg.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.SVNRepository.log() with the startRev same as the latest revision of the repository and the startRev -1. In this case, the implementation of SVNKit's SVNRepository.log() will put endRev = startRev, so you are expected to get the latest SVNLogEntry. However the call to that method return no log entry in our case, why?\nThe problems lies at the fact that ASF has a central SVN repository with a lot of projects there, so the latest revision in our case doesn't correspond to a change made to the path /commons/proper/io (in repo) that is why it returns no log entries. However when we call SVNRepository.getLatestRevision() it will return the latest revision of the repository, and in our case because someone has made a change to another project within ASF's repository all the repo's tree revision number will equal to the latest commit number.\nIn other words there is a problem with the implementation of SVNAccessorImpl:\nIf we have a repository with lot of projects we cant add one of those projects to Alitheia. I believe that this is a serious limitation, having in mind that ASF is a very valuable repository of OSS projects, especially of Java based projects (look at Apache Commons).\nI think there is a workaround here. Here is the description:\nLet say we have a repo with multiply projects and we want to get the last commit of a certain project (suppose ASF's repo). We create the repository object for that project (commons-io):\n    DAVRepositoryFactory.setup();\n    String url = \"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io\";\n    SVNURL svnurl = SVNURL.parseURIDecoded(url);\n    SVNRepository repository = SVNRepositoryFactory.create(svnurl);\n    ISVNAuthenticationManager authenticationManager =     \n                                    SVNWCUtil.createDefaultAuthenticationManager();\n    repository.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);\nIn order to get the last log of the repo we have:\n    long lastRev = repository.getLatestRevision();\nThe lastRev, however, might be a revision that doesn't affect the project, so in your implementation it can not be resolved (see SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision()).\nIn order to get (or let say to resolve) the last revision that affected any of the files/folder under /commons/proper/io we can take all the logs:\nCollection<SVNLogEntry> logs = repository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, null, 0, lastRev, true, true);\nand the last revision is the last item at logs collection. Or a better implementation would be:\nrepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n        @Override\n        public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n            System.out.println(\"Last rev (handler):\" + svnLogEntry.getRevision());\n        }\n    });\nThe last implementation, will avoid to download all log entries, and it will start in descending order, so the last revision will be the first entry that is passed at handler (look at parameters, we have set lastRev, 0). With this code you can easily resolve last revisions in repositories such as this, we are working with. I think the only method that must be changed would be the:\nprivate long getHeadSVNRevision() throws InvalidRepositoryException {\n    long endRevision = -1;\n    if (svnRepository == null) {\n        connectToRepository();\n    }\n    try {\n        long lastRev = svnRepository.getLatestRevision();\n        final Rev revision = new Rev(-1);\n        svnRepository.log(new String[]{\"\"}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {\n                revision.rev = svnLogEntry.getRevision();\n            }\n        });\n        endRevision = revision.rev;\n    } catch (SVNException e) {\n        logger.warn(\"Could not get latest revision of \" + url\n                + e.getMessage());\n        throw new InvalidRepositoryException(url, e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    return endRevision;\n}\n\nprivate static class Rev { long rev; Rev(long r) { rev = r; } }\nIn my case it works, however, I cant say for sure if it affects other components of alitheia because, I haven't managed to Add Project (it can't find a BTS accessor and Mail accessor so it throws exceptions) so I cant Update All and try some metrics (or in the best scenario I haven't any test cases to run against).\n*It is very strange the procedure of how should someone can Add Project *\nEDIT:\nThe new implementation of getHeadSVNRevision() will work the same as the previous one if there is a \"one project per repo\", it will return the HEAD of the whole repo, however if there is a \"multiply projects per repo\" it will return the last log that affected any of the files under the path that scm.source URL is pointing.", "eligu opened this issue on 3 Nov 2013 \u00b7 13 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/87", "I can add a new user from the Phabricator web ui, but how can the user log in?

It helped me to increase the productivity of my customer and to tighten the requirements definition process and management as well. Basically what the KOREM plugin was intended for.\nAs I suggested my customer to select a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach for their projects to collect requirements I added the possibility to KOREM to add so called features from the BDD philosophy to the Redmine database. For further information on this please read on here.\nOne missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.\nSo I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the \"Export\" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.\nI would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.\nCheers,\nMarvin Kruse\nPhilotech GmbH", "gimmebytes wants to merge 15 commits into tmerten:master\nfrom gimmebytes:master", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/churchlab/millstone/issues/612", "For example, a large deletion doesn't work right now.

For further information on this please read on here.\nOne missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.\nSo I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the \"Export\" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.\nI would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.\nCheers,\nMarvin Kruse\nPhilotech GmbH", "gimmebytes wants to merge 15 commits into tmerten:master\nfrom gimmebytes:master", "Unsolved"]], "python": [["https://github.com/FOSSEE/sees/issues/1", "Slide 18 of basic python\nInclude the Long datatype in numberic", "srikantpatnaik opened this issue on 29 Aug 2011 \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/pzfreo/ox-clo/issues/23", "The mapper and reducer Python examples print formatted strings.

The orbiter was also supposed to be the communications relay for the Mars Polar Lander. NASA launched this device into Mars to achieve several science objectives. First, the device was expected to monitor the weather & atmospheric conditions in Mars on a daily basis. The climate orbiter was also required to record and report any evidence of climate change. Other objectives included an analysis of the water distribution, temperature profiles, water vapour, and dust content on the Martian Surface.\n2 The NASA Mars Orbiter\n2.1 A catastrophic Software Failure:\n    The NASA Mars Orbiter was developed and launched at a time when NASA was operating under the \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d philosophy that was supposed to encourage the organization to achieve more objectives with fewer resources (MCO, 2000). The organization aimed at increasing productivity & innovation while at the same time ensuring cost-effective and safe approaches to the achievement of mission success. The \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d initiative led to the restructuring of many missions and programs to achieve the objectives of this approach (MCO, 2000). Using this approach, the costs incurred in programs were highly reduced but the infusion of technology and content were increased. This is the background and philosophy under which NASA was operating when the Mars Orbiter was launched. This approach may be a contributing factor to the failure in the greater scheme of things.\n\nThis is because, as the implementation of projects using this approach evolved, the attention on schedule & cost increased leading to unacceptable levels of risk in NASA projects (MCO, 2000). Even today, NASA may be operating using an approach where there is very high risk in some initiatives by increasing scope and reducing cost (Stone, 2000). \n2.2 The NASA Mars Orbiter Software Failure:\nReports indicate that the failure of the NASA Mars Orbiter was caused by a catastrophic failure in a piece of ground software. The failure on the ground software led to some discrepancies since this software calculated & produced its results in imperial units while the system that was expecting the results of these calculations was expecting them in ISO / metric units (Hoekenga, 2012). Therefore, the error in the navigation of the obiter device was caused by the software that controlled the thrusters since it was not calibrated in SI units i.e. the navigation device in the orbiter expected to receive the values in Newtons while the computer that completed the calculations delivered pound-forces (Board, 1999). According to Douglas & Don (1999), this piece of ground software may have been inadequately tested leading to the errors that were experienced in the calculations. As a result of the delivery of results using the wrong units there was a discrepancy in the calculated & measured positions of the orbiter which led to a large discrepancy in the location of the device in terms of its expected & actual position in orbital insertion altitude. Even though this was earlier noted by some engineers, their concerns were dismissed but later it emerged that the orbiter was in the wrong position in terms of its orbital insertion altitude (Douglas & Don, 1999). This discrepancy led to the loss of the orbiter which probably crashed in an unknown location. After the error was discovered, an urgent meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a trajectory manoeuvre. However, this manoeuvre was ultimately dismissed as the NASA Mars Orbiter was considered lost. There were some responses by NASA following this catastrophic failure and loss of the orbiter. In the next section, we shall consider the actions taken by NASA and the appropriateness of these measures.\n2.3 Responses to the Failure of the Software and their Appropriateness:\nImmediately after the loss of the orbiter, NASA constituted a board called the \u201cMars Climate Orbiter Board\u201d to investigate the matter and forward their recommendations to NASA (MCO, 2000). The report produced by the board cited some contributory factors that led to this catastrophic failure. The report noted that the errors that were being experienced but went undetected within the computer models of the ground-based systems in relation to how thruster firings were being predicted and executed. The computer based models on the ground missed the errors experienced in the thrust firings while the orbiter was in its interplanetary journey to Mars. MCO (2000) noted that the software error that led to the loss of the orbiter was not the first error by the software. The author predicts that there were other small errors in the interplanetary trip that were not noted by ground computer models. \n\nAnother contributory factor as noted by the board was that the navigation team in the NASA operations centre was not quite informed on the details of how the orbiter was pointed in space as accurately as it was done in other programs. Further, the fact that the optional thrust firing to raise the path of the orbiter relative to mars was considered but it was not performed was also a contributory factor. The board also noted that the Systems Engineering department of NASA was required to double-check the operation of all interconnected parts but this was not done well (MCO, 2000). There was also the problem of informal communication channels among engineering groups and some personnel were not trained sufficiently on the navigational aspects of the operation. Ultimately, the process of verification and validation of systems engineering requirements and technical aspects of the project was inadequate.\n\nWhen the software error was discovered, NASA called an immediate meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5). However, this manoeuvre was never done after consultations with NASA top management. After the investigations and recommendations by the board, NASA took some actions to ensure that such a failure would not occur again. In response to the recommendations of the board, NASA has taken some efforts to ensure that the systems engineering team is fully staffed at the beginning of each project. Further, the organization makes sure that the engineering team is in possession of the required skills to work with the subsystem engineers and set up an efficient communication flow. NASA also engages personnel in operations at the early stages of the project to ensure that they have a detailed knowledge of the project. In the project formulation phase, a set of mission requirements is developed early in the project formulation phase, Further, a \u201cthrough flow-down\u201d of the requirements of every system is done to the subsystem level (MCO, 2000). According to MCO (2000), NASA also conducts system analyses to identify mission risks in all segments and sub-systems in the project. The project teams must also work thoroughly to make \u201ctrade-off decisions\u201d that treat & mitigate risks in a bid to increase the probability of mission success (MCO, 2000). A recommendation has also been made and approved to deploy alternative navigational schemes in space missions and \u201crelative navigation\u201d is done when the device is in the vicinity of other planets (MCO, 2000). Technology developments for optical tracking, autonomous orbital determination based on GPS is also being pursued.\n\nThe immediate action taken by NASA to conduct an emergency meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was appropriate and it may have resulted in positive impacts on the project. However, their resolution to dismiss the TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5) meant that this immediate action did not achieve any result. I think that this effort did not lead to positive results for the mission since the team did not conduct the TCM-5 manoeuvre. The team should have completed the TCM-5 manoeuvre since it would have had no further consequences on the costs of the mission.\n\nThe long-term actions mentioned above will have far reaching implications for NASA. After the recommendations of the investigations board, the actions of NASA to establish a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training will lead to more costs being incurred. However, even though more costs will be incurred, these actions are appropriate since they can prevent mission failure which leads to even greater financial losses. For instance, the loss of the orbiter led to a $125 million loss. Taking actions such as the ones recommended above will led to increased costs but these will not be in the scale of the cost of mission failure. Their actions to perform continual system analysis, risk identification, tracking technology and alternative navigational schemes are also appropriate but they will lead to more costs being incurred. Similarly, these costs do not surpass the costs of mission failure which means that these actions are justifiable.\n3 Conclusion\nThe loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter led to a loss of at least $125 million \u2013 the loss was due to a failure in software. The ground based software calculated its output in imperial units while the orbiter was expecting these results in ISO / Metric Units. The measures taken by NASA in accordance to the report by the investigation board included the establishment of a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training. Other measures included performing continual system analysis, risk identification, using tracking technology and developing alternative navigational schemes. Even though these measures will increase operational costs for NASA, they are appropriate since they can be justified by the fact that the additional costs cannot be compared to the costs of mission failure.\n\n4 Reference List\nBoard, M.

chapter\nWhat Counts is Decisions, Not Numbers \u2013 Towards an Analytics Design Sheet\nURL to the chapter\nhttps://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/GunetherRuhe/RuheNayebi.md\nMessage?\nWhat is the chapter's clear and approachable take away message?\nCurrently, most decisions in software engineering are made intutively. This must change; more decisions must be made analytically; this chapter describes an analystics design sheet whose adoption will transform decision-making.\nAccessible?\nIs the chapters written for a generalist audience (no excessive use of technical terminology) with a minimum of diagrams and references?\nThe chapter is indeed aimed at a generalist audience.\nHow can it be made more accessible to generalist?\nImprove the illustrative example with more concrete detail, a point to which I return below.\nSize?\nIs the chapter the right length?\nI understand the lenght to be 4 pages, including references. The current draft is one line over.\nWhat are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?\nThe example would be more helpful if it were more concrete; specifically, if the nodes in the conceptual model were spelled out: the letters E, S, and F are quite abstract.\nCopyedits\nThe following sentence parses poorly.\n\"This often implies delays in delivering products or lack of quality.\"\nThe problem is that one can distribute the gerund over the or,\nnot the verb implies. I suggest\nThis often implies lack of quality or delays in delivering products.\nBefore the bullet list at the end of the introduction: to-wards -> towards.\nIn the bulleted list,\n\"likelihood to make\" -> \"likelihood of making\"\n\"likelihood of avoiding to make\" -> \"likelihood of avoiding making\"\nstill better would be\n\"likelihood of avoiding a wrong decision\"\nThe most important types of analytics are the ones least studied by researchers [5].\nCitation abuse is making a citation that does not stand on its own, but requires the reader to consult the referenced work in detail to understand the citation. Here, \"important types\" is vague; why force the reader to read unnamed authors et al. [5] to learn what they are?\nAHS -> ADS\nTitles are not in title case.\nCitations are not nouns.\nGotta Mantra?\nWe encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.\nA checklist for software decisions\nSupporting software decisions\nBest Points\nIn seeking to support decision making in software engineering, the authors are attacking a seminal, yet neglected software engineering problem.", "barr opened this issue on 21 Dec 2015 \u00b7 2 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/issues/118", "MERE NUMBERS AREN'T ENOUGH: A PLEA FOR VISUALIZATION\nVery nice concept, I'm in complete agreement on the value of visualizing data, when it's done well. The two examples are classic software engineering tasks that can be helped by appropriate visualization of relevant data.\nThe presentation in the article needs some improvement.\nFEATURE SCOPING\n\"scope out\" sounds strange (to my American ear). It would be much easier to understand if \"exclude\" were used. For example:\nReplace \"... which to scope out from the current project.\"\nwith \"... which to exclude from the current project. \"\nscoped out -> excluded\nI don't understand the phrase \"basic average share of descoped features\".\nThe next sentence isn't really a sentence. What didn't happen \"until they presented the feature survival chart\" ??\nPresumably Figure X means figure 1.\nBut the figure itself is confusing, and the text seems to be confused also. The text seems to have the x and y-axes interchanged. Aren't the features on the y-axis, and the milestones on the x-axis?\nInstead of \"nuances of green\", it would be better to say \"shades of green\".\nThe paragraph just above the figure mentions the marked decision points numbered 1 through 5, but doesn't explain anything about what the decisions were, or how the feature scoping affected the decisions. Even in this short overview article, at least a couple of sentences about the actual use of the chart would be helpful.\nREGRESSION TESTING\nPresumably Figure Y means figure 2.\nThe picture looks colorful and nice, but without an explanation, I can only guess what the different colors mean. Does the first row mean that Unit Testing was done intensely on about 15 features in V 3.0, intensely on 2, and less intensely on 12 features in 3.2, and not at all in 3.3?", "tostrand opened this issue on 15 Dec 2015 \u00b7 1 comment", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/142", "Hello,\nSame issue as #141 for Lang 44b.

It gives the idea that testing is important to the product software. It does not contain information about how the investigation should be performed and to what extent developers can rely on testing.\nAs an expansion to the above, this report first analyses the role of testing in software development process, then introduces some rules of thumbs to apply general testing techniques, and finally discusses what testing is not and what cannot be achieved through testing.\n2.The Role of Testing in Software Development\nThe importance of testing in a software development process is necessary to be understood by every software engineer, but is also trivial. Testing does not only reduce number of bugs in codes, it also examines if the implemented functionalities meet the corresponding requirements.\n2.1 Testing in Waterfall Model\nIn a traditional waterfall model, testing is the one last step before the product system is delivered to customer. All assessments about meeting the requirements are carried out at this stage. However, with very limited time allowed for the entire project, it is very often that the time remaining for testing is squeezed heavily.\nMoreover, In a fast changing environment, it is quite possible that by the time the system is completed, the original requirements may have already become old fashioned. In addition, in the case of a small project, more time could be spent on planning and documentation than on designing, implementing and testing.\nThus, comprehensive testing is rarely finished. The step which is equivalent to quality checking for the product system cannot receive enough time to proceed. [2]\n2.2 Testing in Incremental Model\nIn contrast with waterfall model, the incremental model has emerged in this rapidly changing environment. Methods of this model like Agile or XP usually use a test-driven development approach. In this approach, the whole project is broken down into several increments or iterations to be completed in shorter time boxes. In each iteration, tests are written before the actual implementation. An implementation is correct only if it can pass the existing test cases designed for it.\nAs a result, testing is interleaved with analysis, design, and implementation. So developers can spend more effective time on testing to have it carefully planned and carried out.\n3.Principles of Testing\nAfter having a good understanding of the importance of testing, this section discusses how general testing methods and techniques, i.e. static and dynamic methods, box testing, unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, etc., are applied in normal software development projects.\n3.1 Test a program to try to make it fail\nDijkstra said that \"testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3]\". The interpretation of this is obvious: except for trivial systems, those many test cases a developer can come up with are just a part of all possible scenarios. So testing is to execute the program with the intention to find bugs [4], not with the intention to show it is bug free. A good testing practice should show the program fails at some point, and after debugging, it can show the program successes at the same point.\n3.2 Test early and regularly\nNot surprising at all, fixing bugs is more expensive if it spotted at a later stage, but it is surprising how tremendously more expensive it is. Figure 1 shows that, in a waterfall model, cost of finding and fixing bugs is the result of an exponential function of time. It is also the case in test-driven approach, where a bug in an early iteration can accumulate to become a bigger problem and propagate to other components.\nFigure 1. Cost of Fixing Bugs in Warterfall Model [5]\nAdditionally, tests should be carried out on a regular basis since when new components are added in, they may have unexpected effects on existing ones. Also, as long as the requirements are changed, test cases should be updated accordingly.\n3.3 Testing is context dependant\nThe test methods to be used should depend on the context of the system to satisfy various requirements [6]. Test cases should be composed according to different components. Even with the same component in the same system, testing objectives can be different at different point of time. For example, unit testing checks if each component functions properly as individuals, while integration testing focuses on interaction between several components as a whole.\n3.4 Define a Test Plan\nA test plan should address test scope, test strategy, test methods and techniques, test results interpretation, and how comprehensive the test cases are to cover the possible scenarios. Also importantly, it should include how the tests are going to reveal the customer requirements, and how requirements are measured [7][8][9]. Furthermore, a risk assessment of the system under development should be considered here. The essence of risk assessment can be illustrated from the negative results of software disasters such as the Denver Airport Baggage Handling System [10] and the Fukoshima Nuclear Disaster [11]. Missing or under evaluating a risk may result in too few or even no specific tests covering this risk at all, which will further result in hidden faults, which finally leads to system failure.\n3.5 Test for valid as well as invalid inputs\nTest cases should of course include valid inputs, thus to mimic regular scenarios, which are the most likely real life situations. After those, developers should think about if things can go wrong with invalid inputs such as null pointers, out-of-bound index, etc. The reason is not only because statistically there are always a chance for exceptions to occur, but it is also quite often that a system is crashed by a single component which has got an unexpected input. Moreover, an interesting thing is, during testing, invalid input conditions seem to have higher error detection yield than test cases with valid input conditions [4].\n4.Limitations of Testing\n4.1 Testing cannot show bug-free\nAlso according to that famous quote of Dijkstra: \"Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3].\" In reality, testing is based on comparing actual outputs to expected outputs of a component in response to some inputs. These inputs are just a subset of all possible scenarios. Since very likely there are a great many of possibilities, it is rarely practical for one to be able to carry out exhaust testing. Hence, a good test case may indicate the existence of a fault within some component, or after the fault is corrected, it may show that component does not produce a particular kind of error when it receives a particular kind of input, but it never gives the idea that this component does not produce any kind of bug in response to any kind of input.\n4.2 Tests are no substitute for specifications\nWith test-driven methods, developers write codes to pass the tests. Conventionally, the code becomes deliverable once it passes all tests. So to some extent, testing has substituted the requirement specification. However, tests, no matter how many test cases they include, are just instances of the requirements, which provide an abstraction of the expected outcome [12]. It is true that requirement specification is used for generating test cases, but inversely, using test cases to summarise a requirement is a conduct should be avoided. It is like a universal statement can be used to prove as many existential statements with the same predicate as desired, but no matter how many existential statements conjunction together, they cannot be used to prove a single universal statement with the same predicate.\n4.3 Software testing does not help in finding root causes\nIEEE standard terminology states:\n\"An unsatisfactory program execution is a 'failure', pointing to a 'fault' in the program, itself is the result of a 'mistake' in the programmer\u2019s thinking.\"\nAccording to section 3.1, testing is to execute the program to make it fail. It is the process to uncover failures in the program. So testing tells the developers the test subject does not generate satisfactory output in response to some certain inputs. However, it does not tell how the inputs are processed to result in such outputs. In other words, testing does not help in finding root causes, i.e. where, when, and how things go wrong, which lead the software to malfunction in the first place. That is done via another distinct activity known as debugging.\n4.4 Extra Coding and Extra Chance to Have Bugs\nNo matter how automated the testing procedure a project is using, it requires some minimal level of human coding in the first place. Obviously, coding for testing means extra work to do. From instantiating components and initialising test inputs, to inter-component communication and results interpretation\uff0c every piece of work is an additional programming task. Moreover, additional programming means additional chance to have bugs. For a failed test case, a developer has to check both the source code and test code for faults, because it may turn out to be that the logic or result interpretation is wrong within the test code.\n5.Recommendation\nLet us examine the definition in section 1 given by Kaner again. It is true that passing tests can at least show the software does not produce faulty outputs in situations covered by existing test cases. Plus, if these test cases are carefully planned, then it is reasonable for the stakeholders to be confident in the software's correctness. So the connection between testing and quality does exist and is important to keep in mind.\nHowever, passing tests is equivalent to quality assurance for the product system is usually not the case. Test cases are instances of real life situations. They are elements of a subset of all possible inputs. What testing can prove is merely the performance based on that subset. Using the property of a subset to draw a conclusion for the full set is absolutely invalid.\n6.References\n[1] Kaner, C, 2006, Exploratory Testing, Key Note at QAI\nhttp://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf\n[2] Sommerville, I, 2011, Software Engineering, 9th Edition, Pearson, Boston\n[3] Dijkstra J.N.

Using the property of a subset to draw a conclusion for the full set is absolutely invalid.\n6.References\n[1] Kaner, C, 2006, Exploratory Testing, Key Note at QAI\nhttp://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf\n[2] Sommerville, I, 2011, Software Engineering, 9th Edition, Pearson, Boston\n[3] Dijkstra J.N.

The main objective of test plan is examine the program behavior and accuracy. The functioning of the game is to tilt the gaming board (4X4 grid) to move the tiles containing values floating on the board in the left, right, top and bottom direction. The objective of the game is to merge the two tiles containing the same values and the resulting tile will represent the summation of two equal values. After merging two tiles a tilt of the gaming board in any direction will generate a new tile with the multiple value of 2, 4, 16 e.g. The ultimate goal of the game is to achieve a tile containing the value 2048. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value produced with the merging of two identical tiles. At the beginning of the game two tiles containing either 2 or 4 will be appeared in two random locations of the gaming board. The score will be initialized as zero at the beginning of the game. The game will be considered to be over while there is no empty cell left to move any of the tiles on the board and while the player achieved the tile containing value 2048.\nSoftware Specifications\ni. NetBeans IDE version 8\nii. Github account algh0065\niii. Internet connection\nTest Scenarios\nGame Board Representation\nAt the initial stage of the game a test is performed to check the representation of the board. The test is performed for game board representation as follows:\ni. A 4X4 grid will represent the entire board of the game, where two tiles will be highlighted at random locations of the board in the beginning.\nii. The highlighted two tiles will contain 2 values individually.\nSubstantiation of User Input\nIn order to verify the user input the following test steps are performed.\ni. The input is considered to be valid if the user chooses any of the keyboard buttons namely 1, 2, 3, 4, or x.\nii. The input is considered to be invalid if the use chooses any other buttons other than 1, 2, 3, 4 or x.\niii. An invalid input resulting in error message pop-up saying that invalid input.\nConducting User Input\nThis will test the movements of the board while pressing particular input button.\ni. The game board must be tilted up for the input of \u20181\u2019 button of the keyboard.\nii. The game board must be tilted down for the input of \u20182\u2019 button of the keyboard.\niii. The game board must be tilted right for the input of \u20183\u2019 button of the keyboard.\niv. The game board must be tilted left for the input of \u20184\u2019 button of the keyboard.\nTilting in the Up Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move up.\ni. Tiles must move to the up when there are empty cells in the above of the columns of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the up and merge a tile of the same value in the above of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the up when there is no empty cell in the above of the column of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the up when they reached the top most position (i.e., top edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Down Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move down.\ni. Tiles must move to the down when there are empty cells in the below of the columns of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the down and merge a tile of the same value in the below of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the down when there is no empty cell in the below of the column of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the down when they reached the bottom most position (i.e., bottom edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Right Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move right.\ni. Tiles must move to the right when there are empty cells in the right of the rows of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the right and merge a tile of the same value in the right of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the right when there is no empty cell in the right of the row of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the right when they reached the right most position (i.e., right edge) of the board.\nTilting in the Left Direction\nThis will test the conditions for which the tiles will move left.\ni. Tiles must move to the left when there are empty cells in the left of the rows of current tiles position.\nii. One Tile must move to the left and merge a tile of the same value in the left of the current tile value.\niii. A Tile must not move to the left when there is no empty cell in the left of the row of the current tile position.\niv. Tiles must not move to the left when they reached the left most position (i.e., left edge) of the board.\nCondition for Merging Two Tiles\nThis will illustrate the condition for which two tiles will be merged into one.\ni. Merging is possible to get one tile with the addition of the values containing two tiles only when the two tiles containing the same value and positioned adjacent to each other.\nScore Calculation\nThe score of the game will be calculated in the following ways:\nii. At the very beginning of the game the score will be initialized as zero.\niii. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value obtained through merging of two tiles of equal values.\nGame Expiration (Game Over)\nThe game will be expired in the following conditions:\ni. The user may terminate the game anytime during the game by pressing the \u2018x\u2019 button.\nii. The game will be terminated when the user achieved the desired value 2048 in one tile and a message will pop-up representing game over.\niii. The game will be terminated when there is no empty cell left to move any of the tiles in any direction and a message will pop-up representing game over.\nGame Limitations\nThe limitations of the game is pointed in the following\ni. There is no option for this game kept for multi-user at a time.\nii. There are no multiple levels maintained for this game.\niii. Since it is a single player game the networking option is invalid.\nDependencies and Risks\nThere are some dependencies and risks reflected with this game. It is recommended that the user should learn the functioning and the rules of the game in order to be able to avoid risks for playing the game.", "algh0065 opened this issue on 8 Jul 2014 \u00b7 2 comments", "Unsolved"]], "(resubmission)": [["https://github.com/gardners/2014SE3/issues/250", "Introduction\nThis practical will supply a comprehensive test plan for the game 2048.

It helped me to increase the productivity of my customer and to tighten the requirements definition process and management as well. Basically what the KOREM plugin was intended for.\nAs I suggested my customer to select a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach for their projects to collect requirements I added the possibility to KOREM to add so called features from the BDD philosophy to the Redmine database. For further information on this please read on here.\nOne missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.\nSo I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the \"Export\" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.\nI would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.\nCheers,\nMarvin Kruse\nPhilotech GmbH", "gimmebytes wants to merge 15 commits into tmerten:master\nfrom gimmebytes:master", "Unsolved"]], "slides": [["https://github.com/ict4g/ase2017/issues/2", "make pdf versions of the sliides and reference them from the README file", "avillafiorita opened this issue on 17 Sep 2017 \u00b7 0 comments", "Unsolved"], ["https://github.com/hburden/DAT255/issues/53", "No description provided.", "m0ar opened this issue on 16 Sep 2014 \u00b7 2 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/hburden/DAT255/issues/39", "Inga slides f\u00f6r f\u00f6rel\u00e4sning 2", "morganericsson opened this issue on 17 Mar 2014 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/jce-il/se-class/issues/25", "\u05d4\u05e6\u05e2\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d8 \u05d8\u05d9\u05e4 \u05d8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4.pptx", "robi-y opened this issue on 29 Feb 2016 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/unibas-sweng/software-engineering/issues/7", "There are images missing from the images folder for the presentation.\nThe affected lines are Line 49 and Line 58.\nI did not add the images itself via a pull request due to the question whether the individual licensing of the images, especially the drill seargent, is not fully known.", "schoenja opened this issue on 22 Sep 2017 \u00b7 1 comment", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse/issues/22", "see remote workshop: marp presentation with only images, script = markdown-files in repo", "stevenschwenke opened this issue on 21 Aug 2017 \u00b7 0 comments", "Solved"], ["https://github.com/laboon/CS1530_Summer2017/issues/29", "I am not sure if I am missing something, but I think we are missing a few lecture slides.

The current draft is one line over.\nWhat are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?\nThe example would be more helpful if it were more concrete; specifically, if the nodes in the conceptual model were spelled out: the letters E, S, and F are quite abstract.\nCopyedits\nThe following sentence parses poorly.\n\"This often implies delays in delivering products or lack of quality.\"\nThe problem is that one can distribute the gerund over the or,\nnot the verb implies.

[5] to learn what they are?\nAHS -> ADS\nTitles are not in title case.\nCitations are not nouns.\nGotta Mantra?\nWe encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE?

The orbiter was also supposed to be the communications relay for the Mars Polar Lander. NASA launched this device into Mars to achieve several science objectives. First, the device was expected to monitor the weather & atmospheric conditions in Mars on a daily basis. The climate orbiter was also required to record and report any evidence of climate change. Other objectives included an analysis of the water distribution, temperature profiles, water vapour, and dust content on the Martian Surface.\n2 The NASA Mars Orbiter\n2.1 A catastrophic Software Failure:\n    The NASA Mars Orbiter was developed and launched at a time when NASA was operating under the \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d philosophy that was supposed to encourage the organization to achieve more objectives with fewer resources (MCO, 2000). The organization aimed at increasing productivity & innovation while at the same time ensuring cost-effective and safe approaches to the achievement of mission success. The \u201cFaster, Better, Cheaper\u201d initiative led to the restructuring of many missions and programs to achieve the objectives of this approach (MCO, 2000). Using this approach, the costs incurred in programs were highly reduced but the infusion of technology and content were increased. This is the background and philosophy under which NASA was operating when the Mars Orbiter was launched. This approach may be a contributing factor to the failure in the greater scheme of things.\n\nThis is because, as the implementation of projects using this approach evolved, the attention on schedule & cost increased leading to unacceptable levels of risk in NASA projects (MCO, 2000). Even today, NASA may be operating using an approach where there is very high risk in some initiatives by increasing scope and reducing cost (Stone, 2000). \n2.2 The NASA Mars Orbiter Software Failure:\nReports indicate that the failure of the NASA Mars Orbiter was caused by a catastrophic failure in a piece of ground software. The failure on the ground software led to some discrepancies since this software calculated & produced its results in imperial units while the system that was expecting the results of these calculations was expecting them in ISO / metric units (Hoekenga, 2012). Therefore, the error in the navigation of the obiter device was caused by the software that controlled the thrusters since it was not calibrated in SI units i.e. the navigation device in the orbiter expected to receive the values in Newtons while the computer that completed the calculations delivered pound-forces (Board, 1999). According to Douglas & Don (1999), this piece of ground software may have been inadequately tested leading to the errors that were experienced in the calculations. As a result of the delivery of results using the wrong units there was a discrepancy in the calculated & measured positions of the orbiter which led to a large discrepancy in the location of the device in terms of its expected & actual position in orbital insertion altitude. Even though this was earlier noted by some engineers, their concerns were dismissed but later it emerged that the orbiter was in the wrong position in terms of its orbital insertion altitude (Douglas & Don, 1999). This discrepancy led to the loss of the orbiter which probably crashed in an unknown location. After the error was discovered, an urgent meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a trajectory manoeuvre. However, this manoeuvre was ultimately dismissed as the NASA Mars Orbiter was considered lost. There were some responses by NASA following this catastrophic failure and loss of the orbiter. In the next section, we shall consider the actions taken by NASA and the appropriateness of these measures.\n2.3 Responses to the Failure of the Software and their Appropriateness:\nImmediately after the loss of the orbiter, NASA constituted a board called the \u201cMars Climate Orbiter Board\u201d to investigate the matter and forward their recommendations to NASA (MCO, 2000). The report produced by the board cited some contributory factors that led to this catastrophic failure. The report noted that the errors that were being experienced but went undetected within the computer models of the ground-based systems in relation to how thruster firings were being predicted and executed. The computer based models on the ground missed the errors experienced in the thrust firings while the orbiter was in its interplanetary journey to Mars. MCO (2000) noted that the software error that led to the loss of the orbiter was not the first error by the software. The author predicts that there were other small errors in the interplanetary trip that were not noted by ground computer models. \n\nAnother contributory factor as noted by the board was that the navigation team in the NASA operations centre was not quite informed on the details of how the orbiter was pointed in space as accurately as it was done in other programs. Further, the fact that the optional thrust firing to raise the path of the orbiter relative to mars was considered but it was not performed was also a contributory factor. The board also noted that the Systems Engineering department of NASA was required to double-check the operation of all interconnected parts but this was not done well (MCO, 2000). There was also the problem of informal communication channels among engineering groups and some personnel were not trained sufficiently on the navigational aspects of the operation. Ultimately, the process of verification and validation of systems engineering requirements and technical aspects of the project was inadequate.\n\nWhen the software error was discovered, NASA called an immediate meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5). However, this manoeuvre was never done after consultations with NASA top management. After the investigations and recommendations by the board, NASA took some actions to ensure that such a failure would not occur again. In response to the recommendations of the board, NASA has taken some efforts to ensure that the systems engineering team is fully staffed at the beginning of each project. Further, the organization makes sure that the engineering team is in possession of the required skills to work with the subsystem engineers and set up an efficient communication flow. NASA also engages personnel in operations at the early stages of the project to ensure that they have a detailed knowledge of the project. In the project formulation phase, a set of mission requirements is developed early in the project formulation phase, Further, a \u201cthrough flow-down\u201d of the requirements of every system is done to the subsystem level (MCO, 2000). According to MCO (2000), NASA also conducts system analyses to identify mission risks in all segments and sub-systems in the project. The project teams must also work thoroughly to make \u201ctrade-off decisions\u201d that treat & mitigate risks in a bid to increase the probability of mission success (MCO, 2000). A recommendation has also been made and approved to deploy alternative navigational schemes in space missions and \u201crelative navigation\u201d is done when the device is in the vicinity of other planets (MCO, 2000). Technology developments for optical tracking, autonomous orbital determination based on GPS is also being pursued.\n\nThe immediate action taken by NASA to conduct an emergency meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was appropriate and it may have resulted in positive impacts on the project. However, their resolution to dismiss the TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5) meant that this immediate action did not achieve any result. I think that this effort did not lead to positive results for the mission since the team did not conduct the TCM-5 manoeuvre. The team should have completed the TCM-5 manoeuvre since it would have had no further consequences on the costs of the mission.\n\nThe long-term actions mentioned above will have far reaching implications for NASA. After the recommendations of the investigations board, the actions of NASA to establish a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training will lead to more costs being incurred. However, even though more costs will be incurred, these actions are appropriate since they can prevent mission failure which leads to even greater financial losses. For instance, the loss of the orbiter led to a $125 million loss. Taking actions such as the ones recommended above will led to increased costs but these will not be in the scale of the cost of mission failure. Their actions to perform continual system analysis, risk identification, tracking technology and alternative navigational schemes are also appropriate but they will lead to more costs being incurred. Similarly, these costs do not surpass the costs of mission failure which means that these actions are justifiable.\n3 Conclusion\nThe loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter led to a loss of at least $125 million \u2013 the loss was due to a failure in software. The ground based software calculated its output in imperial units while the orbiter was expecting these results in ISO / Metric Units. The measures taken by NASA in accordance to the report by the investigation board included the establishment of a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training. Other measures included performing continual system analysis, risk identification, using tracking technology and developing alternative navigational schemes. Even though these measures will increase operational costs for NASA, they are appropriate since they can be justified by the fact that the additional costs cannot be compared to the costs of mission failure.\n\n4 Reference List\nBoard, M.
